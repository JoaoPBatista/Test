# Create a Process Flow

After [creating a process](<../process.md#create-a-process>), you use a specific [editor](<process-flow-editor.md>) to design its behavior, i.e. the **process flow**. In this editor, you can select any tool available in the [Process Flow Toolbox](<process-flow-toolbox.md>) to be executed in the process flow of your process.
