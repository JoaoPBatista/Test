# Create and Use Roles

You can restrict or allow end-users access to specific screens and operations of your application using your own custom Roles. For example, you can create a back-office Role, set the Role in your application's back-office screens, and grant this Role only to those end-users who are entitled to access the back- office screens.

To create a custom Role, do the following:

1. Go to the Logic tab; 
1. Right-click the Roles folder and select the Add Role option; 
1. Set the Name of your Role and the remaining information. 

Once a new Role is created, you can assign it to end-users through the **Users** application or you can create logic in your application to manage the access.

## Use the Role in your Applicationâ€™s Logic

When you define a new Role in your module, OutSystems provides a set of System Actions, built-in functions, and exceptions necessary to use the Role in your logic.

### Role Actions

For each Role in your module, OutSystems provides the following Actions:

* Check&lt;Role name&gt;Role: Checks whether a specific end-user has been granted access to a specific role. 
* Grant&lt;Role name&gt;Role: Provides access for a specific end-user to a specific role. This action is not available for the System Roles **Anonymous** and **Registered**. 
* Revoke&lt;Role name&gt;Role: denies access for a specific end-user to a specific role. This action is not available for the System Roles Roles **Anonymous** and **Registered**. 

Role Actions are available in the Logic tab, within the Roles folder, under the corresponding Role, and can simply be dropped into your action flow.

### Role Functions

To check end-user Roles in your expressions, OutSystems provides the following built-in function:

* Check&lt;Role name&gt;Role 

This function is available in the Scope Tree of the Expression Editor, under the Roles folder.

### Role Exceptions

For each Role in your module, OutSystems creates the following Exception:

* Not &lt;Role Name&gt;

This Exception is raised when a user tries to access an element, for example a Screen, that requires a specific Role and the user has not been granted with that Role.
